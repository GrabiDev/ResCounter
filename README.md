# ResCounter
This repository contains progress on an app helping immigrants maintain `continuous residence` in the UK.
It should be useful for planning trips and stays abroad, while making sure the HM Government's residency requirements for [`Settled Status`](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/what-settled-and-presettled-status-means) or [`Indefinite Leave to Remain`](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/indefinite-leave-to-remain-calculating-continuous-period-in-uk) are met.

## No warranty
The author of the application takes no responsibility for any inaccurate information provided by the application.
Application is supposed only to provide aid to those determining length of their residency in the UK.
Application cannot be used to make any claims with HM Government institutions.

## Current progress
Working Python prototype is available in `prototype` directory.
Details on the prototype are in the `README.md` file in `prototype` directory.
